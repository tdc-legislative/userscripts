TDC userscripts
===========

- `tdc_jira_autolinker.user.js` &mdash; scans for JIRA ticket IDs and auto-links them to [lisausa.atlassian.com](http://lisausa.atlassian.com). Only applies to text nodes that are not already in an `<a>`. Currently set to operate only on `*.github.com` and `*.hipchat.com`, but feel free to change it if you find another place we're routinely posting those IDs.
